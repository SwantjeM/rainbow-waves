# rainbow-waves

This repository contains rainbow-waves, written in p5.js during a creative coding session at the [recurse center](https://www.recurse.com/). 
The running code is hosted [here](https://swantjem.github.io/rainbow-waves/) and features interactive, exanding, colourful waves on a canvas.
